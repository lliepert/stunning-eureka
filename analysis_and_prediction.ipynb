The following is from the document your link sent me to, with emphases added by me:\\n \\n>We now know from the FBI investigation that:\\n\\n>   More than 2,000 of the 30,490 emails Clinton turned over to the State Department contained classified information, including 110 emails in 52 email chains that contained classified information at the time they were sent or received. (**Most emails were retroactively deemed to contain classified information by the U.S. agencies from which the information originated**.)\\n    Some of the emails containing classified information “bore markings indicating the presence of classified information,” contrary to Clinton’s claims that none was marked classified. **Comey did not provide a specific number**.\\n    “[S]everal thousand work-related emails” were not turned over to the State Department in 2014, but were recovered by the FBI. Comey said **“three of those were classified at the time they were sent or received**.”\\n\\n>At his July 5 press conference, Comey announced his office will not recommend that charges be brought against Clinton or her staff. But the FBI director said Clinton and her staff “were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information.”\\n\\n>“**Only a very small number of the emails containing classified information bore markings indicating the presence of classified information,” Comey said. “But even if information is not marked ‘classified’ in an email, participants who know or should know that the subject matter is classified are still obligated to protect it.**”\\n\\n>Update, July 7: Comey told Congress that three emails sent and received by Clinton had “portion markings” — a letter “C” in the body of the emails — indicating the presence of classified information. **The State Department said it believes that at least two of the emails were marked in error**. \\n\\nBy the actual number provided by the FBI Director, there were **THREE** emails that contained markings that they were classified at the time Clinton sent or received them. Of those three, the State Department said **TWO** were classified in error.   \\n\\nWhat we're left with is there were THREE emails that were **ACTUALLY MARKED** as classified, although there were others that were deemed to be classified, and Clinton should have assumed any email she received was classified.\\n\\nI'm sorry, but this is just another ginned up \"scandal\" that at its core has so little substance, but the vagaries of the classification process and the and misleading use of semantics, along with the partisan scream machine and simply outright stupidity, makes it seem as if there's more to this than what the bottom line actually is. The bottom line is Mrs. Clinton sent (probably, more accurately, forwarded, since she would have definitely known the emails were classified if she marked them herself) three emails that had a section marked with a (c) somewhere in the body of the email. Two of those three were marked as such in error.   \\n\\nWhat Mrs. Clinton did was dumb, but not nefarious, and the FBI Director came to his conclusions as a seasoned investigator AND a lawyer of a not modest background that there was no crime, but this gets blown up as if she were a cross between Ma Barker and Mata Hari. She knows as much about the technology of these things as the average 60-something year old, which is not much, and the continued investigations into this are desperate searches for smoking guns, perjury traps, or just plain \"can I make her look bad\". The facts here are so simple, but so easy to distort, and so it goes.   \\n\\nPeople are entitled to their beliefs and wastes of time, but they not entitled an alternate reality just because they don't like the real one.\\n\\n",null,"2016-09-02T02:48:46.000+0000",2,1,0],[126,"clinton","CMNT","d75fgp7","50n37j","kicktriple","politics","(none)","(none)","As an American, I care deeply.",null,"2016-09-01T10:45:20.000+0000",2,11,0],[127,"clinton","CMNT","d76hwzz","50n37j","upstateman","politics","(none)","(none)","As someone who held a secret security clearance in the past I would care if she did actual wrong.

Trump has no ground game.  Clinton has a fantastic one.  We have never seen that kind of disparity in a national election before.  That could easily mean you get another 2 or 3 points for Clinton on election night (in line with what most political operatives think you can get from a superior ground game).  \\n\\n2. Polling has a history of being shit when it comes to determining Hispanic turnout and support.  A lot of pollsters don't even poll in Spanish, and Spanish-speaking households are more likely to be cell phone only (meaning they are left completely out of polls like Rasmussen).  Personally (and I freely admit this opinion based on anecdotal evidence) I think the big story on election night will be the unexpected size of the Hispanic anti-Trump backlash vote.\\n\\n3. Turnout correlates heavily with education.  There is a huge educational split in this election, with more educated voters tending to favor Hillary (something that was not the case with Obama in 2012--Romney won white college educated voters handily, like all Republican candidates in the history of polling).  Another turnout advantage that could mean she overperforms her polls.

That's part of the reason he earned a reputation as a \"moderate\" and \"centrist\" in the wake of the '00 election.  \"McCain-Feingold\" was a very direct and explicit swipe at the Bush Administration, stemming from the fact that Bush's fundraising team undercut McCain so badly.  McCain was a dissenting vote against Bush's '01 tax cuts.  And McCain was one of the leading critics of the Bush Administration both before and after 9/11 (outspokenly opposing torture when very few other Republicans would).\\n\\nThat's not to speak ill of McCain, pre-2006.  What he did was good, even if it may have come from a vengeful place.  I just say it to illustrate the fact that Republicans backstab each other regularly.  Just ask Trent Lott and Newt Gingrich and Tom DeLay.

People are positioning themselves to best advantage, and often that means sucking up or lashing out in unlikely directions.  The winners, and their attache, tend to gain more prominence.  So the WaPo is a spokesperson for President Bush when Bush is winning and for Obama when Obama is winning.  Meanwhile, politicians shuffle sides behind the scenes because they have interests that don't always align with the party as a whole.\\n\\nIt's not \"good politician\" / \"bad media\".

A charity could have a four-star rating but also be on the watchlist, Thatcher said. In the Clinton Foundation's case, the group cited multiple concerns, including news reports about the foundation accepting donations from foreign governments. It had voluntarily sworn off that practice while Clinton led the State Department, but the donations started again when she left her post. This became a concern as she was expected to announce her presidential bid. Charity Navigator removed the foundation from its watchlist in December, after the foundation amended its tax returns and clarified its position on foreign donations.\\n\\nSo nothing changed in the algorithm..... It placed the Clinton Foundation on the watchlist until they got their amended documentation.

Most of the emails Comey referred to were retroactively classified. The following is from the document your link sent me to, with emphases added by me:\\n \\n>We now know from the FBI investigation that:\\n\\n>   More than 2,000 of the 30,490 emails Clinton turned over to the State Department contained classified information, including 110 emails in 52 email chains that contained classified information at the time they were sent or received. (**Most emails were retroactively deemed to contain classified information by the U.S. agencies from which the information originated**.)\\n    Some of the emails containing classified information “bore markings indicating the presence of classified information,” contrary to Clinton’s claims that none was marked classified. **Comey did not provide a specific number**.\\n    “[S]everal thousand work-related emails” were not turned over to the State Department in 2014, but were recovered by the FBI. Comey said **“three of those were classified at the time they were sent or received**.”\\n\\n>At his July 5 press conference, Comey announced his office will not recommend that charges be brought against Clinton or her staff. But the FBI director said Clinton and her staff “were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information.”\\n\\n>“**Only a very small number of the emails containing classified information bore markings indicating the presence of classified information,” Comey said. “But even if information is not marked ‘classified’ in an email, participants who know or should know that the subject matter is classified are still obligated to protect it.**”\\n\\n>Update, July 7: Comey told Congress that three emails sent and received by Clinton had “portion markings” — a letter “C” in the body of the emails — indicating the presence of classified information. **The State Department said it believes that at least two of the emails were marked in error**. \\n\\nBy the actual number provided by the FBI Director, there were **THREE** emails that contained markings that they were classified at the time Clinton sent or received them. Of those three, the State Department said **TWO** were classified in error.   \\n\\nWhat we're left with is there were THREE emails that were **ACTUALLY MARKED** as classified, although there were others that were deemed to be classified, and Clinton should have assumed any email she received was classified.\\n\\nI'm sorry, but this is just another ginned up \"scandal\" that at its core has so little substance, but the vagaries of the classification process and the and misleading use of semantics, along with the partisan scream machine and simply outright stupidity, makes it seem as if there's more to this than what the bottom line actually is. The bottom line is Mrs. Clinton sent (probably, more accurately, forwarded, since she would have definitely known the emails were classified if she marked them herself) three emails that had a section marked with a (c) somewhere in the body of the email. Two of those three were marked as such in error.   \\n\\nWhat Mrs. Clinton did was dumb, but not nefarious, and the FBI Director came to his conclusions as a seasoned investigator AND a lawyer of a not modest background that there was no crime, but this gets blown up as if she were a cross between Ma Barker and Mata Hari. She knows as much about the technology of these things as the average 60-something year old, which is not much, and the continued investigations into this are desperate searches for smoking guns, perjury traps, or just plain \"can I make her look bad\".

He has promised to make one of our biggest trading partners, China, into a trade war which will devastate our already sour relations with that country.

Trump has no ground game.  Clinton has a fantastic one.  We have never seen that kind of disparity in a national election before.  That could easily mean you get another 2 or 3 points for Clinton on election night (in line with what most political operatives think you can get from a superior ground game).  \\n\\n2. Polling has a history of being shit when it comes to determining Hispanic turnout and support.  A lot of pollsters don't even poll in Spanish, and Spanish-speaking households are more likely to be cell phone only (meaning they are left completely out of polls like Rasmussen).  Personally (and I freely admit this opinion based on anecdotal evidence) I think the big story on election night will be the unexpected size of the Hispanic anti-Trump backlash vote.\\n\\n3. Turnout correlates heavily with education.  There is a huge educational split in this election, with more educated voters tending to favor Hillary (something that was not the case with Obama in 2012--Romney won white college educated voters handily, like all Republican candidates in the history of polling).  Another turnout advantage that could mean she overperforms her polls. </td><td>null</td><td>2016-09-01T15:36:31.000+0000</td><td>1.0</td><td>-1.0</td><td>0.0</td></tr><tr><td>117.0</td><td>clinton</td><td>CMNT</td><td>d7782o3</td><td>50nu5x</td><td>Hydra-Bob</td><td>politics</td><td>(none)</td><td>(none)</td><td>This is a pretty important thing to remember.

All heil Mitt Romney.\\n\\nWhen Bush beat McCain in 2000, John McCain quietly went on the warpath against Bush.  That's part of the reason he earned a reputation as a \"moderate\" and \"centrist\" in the wake of the '00 election.  \"McCain-Feingold\" was a very direct and explicit swipe at the Bush Administration, stemming from the fact that Bush's fundraising team undercut McCain so badly.  McCain was a dissenting vote against Bush's '01 tax cuts.  And McCain was one of the leading critics of the Bush Administration both before and after 9/11 (outspokenly opposing torture when very few other Republicans would).\\n\\nThat's not to speak ill of McCain, pre-2006.  What he did was good, even if it may have come from a vengeful place.  I just say it to illustrate the fact that Republicans backstab each other regularly.  Just ask Trent Lott and Newt Gingrich and Tom DeLay.  When there's blood in the water, politicians pounce and party identification doesn't always save you.\\n\\n> The media wanted Trump to soften his stance while the media was trying to soften its own stance on Trump. CNN for example is happy to employ Trump's former campaign manager Lewandowski. It gives CNN some balance. The New York Times had apparently a reporter post a benign story about Trump softening his stance on immigration only to have it backfire. The media employs people who are friendly to Republicans.\\n\\nMedia figures want access, and the leaders will happily play both sides.  Your fate as a beat report is heavily tied to the candidate you follow, because part of your job is to cozy up to that candidate and gain access.  If your star rises and you become a trusted insider in a campaign, this gives you promotion opportunity at your magazine / tv station of choice.\\n\\nWhat a lot of outsiders see as conspiracy or collusion is, ultimately, just smart business and politics.  People are positioning themselves to best advantage, and often that means sucking up or lashing out in unlikely directions.  The winners, and their attache, tend to gain more prominence.  So the WaPo is a spokesperson for President Bush when Bush is winning and for Obama when Obama is winning.  Meanwhile, politicians shuffle sides behind the scenes because they have interests that don't always align with the party as a whole.\\n\\nIt's not \"good politician\" / \"bad media\".  It's everyone out for themselves, and yesterday's rivals making tomorrows strange bedfellows, purely out of convenience for all involved.</td><td>null</td><td>2016-09-01T14:50:29.000+0000</td><td>1.0</td><td>5.0</td><td>0.0</td></tr><tr><td>69.0</td><td>clinton</td><td>CMNT</td><td>d75r3bm</td><td>50og7j</td><td>ConsonantlyDrunk</td><td>politics</td><td>(none)</td><td>(none)</td><td>Polls-plus includes economic forecasting's influence on election day.

It's stupid of me to insult another person's political views. Sorry about the language. \\n\\nMy problem with libertarianism is that I think a 100% unregulated free market is dangerous and favors the privileged while encouraging exploitation of the un-privileged. \\n\\nLet's take global warming, for example. A libertarian would say that the government should not do anything to encourage or discourage carbon emissions, and that people can choose to spend their money on products made by companies who are more carbon-neutral. There are several problems here - first, the less wealthy you are, the less you can worry about things like a manufacturer's carbon footprint. So, even if you are concerned about the issue but you don't have much money, you have to be more concerned about eating. Second, this favors corporation. A company is going to take the road that makes the most profit. \\n\\nSince global warming can be a contentious issue, let's talk about citizens united. Johnson says citizens united is a first amendment issue, and a corporation should be able to donate as much as they want. By its very nature, this gives the privileged and wealthy more influence over the government than the poor. This is EXACTLY the place where there should be some federal regulation to protect the less privileged class.

He quite literally said he would deport Clinton. How are you supposed to organize and campaign in 2020 when President Trump can just deport your candidate if he gets too popular?\\n\\nThere's nothing we can do to change the facts of this election.

That would actually strengthen NATO if those countries paid their fair share (2% of GDP). Italy, an economy larger than Russia, pays 1%. Germany, the largest in Europe, pays 1.4%. Belgium, only 1%. In fact, 23 countries fail to hit the 2% spending requirement. If those countries met Trumps demands, NATO would be dramatically strengthened. \\n\\n>thinks more countries should have nuclear weapons\\n\\nAgain, I don't believe he actually said that. Clearly he doesn't want Iran to have nuclear weapons - renegotiating the Iran deal has been a staple of his campaign. \\n\\n>and is advocating for trade wars. \\n\\nThe Trump position is that we are already **in** trade wars, except we are getting reamed by everybody else. Trump has been talking about trade policy since the 1970's and wanting to renegotiate current trade deals. He is against TPP, which is a position he shares with Bernie, whereas Hillary has publicly supported it more than 30x (though she now claims to be against it...(she isn't)). Trump is not advocating for trade wars at all. He wants more trade - but rather trade that is more favorable to the USA, rather than lining the pockets of everybody else. \\n\\nThose terrifying policy positions matter way way more to me than concerns about email handling. At the end of the day both candidates have done things that are “disqualifying” in my mind. But we will get one of them, and Trump has just done way more disqualifying things.</td><td>null</td><td>2016-09-03T10:57:35.000+0000</td><td>4.0</td><td>2.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>false</td><td>0.06</td><td>0.861</td><td>0.079</td><td>0.2963</td><td>0.11499999999999999</td><td>0.4225</td><td>false</td></tr><tr><td>115.0</td><td>trump</td><td>CMNT</td><td>d780tye</td><td>50y2dt</td><td>iloveamericandsocanu</td><td>politics</td><td>(none)</td><td>(none)</td><td>The train has no wheels</td><td>null</td><td>2016-09-03T10:57:36.000+0000</td><td>1.0</td><td>2.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>true</td><td>0.355</td><td>0.645</td><td>0.0</td><td>-0.296</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>false</td></tr><tr><td>89.0</td><td>clinton</td><td>CMNT</td><td>d7810c9</td><td>50vn42</td><td>Expiscor</td><td>politics</td><td>(none)</td><td>(none)</td><td>If you ever defend Clinton you're automatically assumed a CTR shill.

For example him talking about the wall has strong racist undertones. </td><td>null</td><td>2016-09-04T06:13:24.000+0000</td><td>4.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>true</td><td>0.324</td><td>0.654</td><td>0.023</td><td>-0.9963</td><td>-0.012013888888888893</td><td>0.517986111111111</td><td>false</td></tr><tr><td>115.0</td><td>trump</td><td>CMNT</td><td>d78z70o</td><td>510yr8</td><td>noCake4u</td><td>politics</td><td>(none)</td><td>(none)</td><td>I don't recall Trump calling black people Super Predators.

There were individual paragraphs within emails that were marked with \"(C)\" next to it. Clinton said she wasn't sure what that marking meant. It's not because she didn't know how to recognize classified information. \"(C)\" is not a proper or common classification marking like this article states or like most assume. The FBI briefing even states that itself.\\n\\nThe FBI briefing also states that for it to be properly marked as classified, there would need to be an appropriate header and footing - neither of which were included in the emails where the \"(C)\" was featured next to certain paragraphs. These were emails she received so it's not Clinton who failed to properly mark/document it.\\n\\n2.

It's stupid of me to insult another person's political views. Sorry about the language. \\n\\nMy problem with libertarianism is that I think a 100% unregulated free market is dangerous and favors the privileged while encouraging exploitation of the un-privileged. \\n\\nLet's take global warming, for example. A libertarian would say that the government should not do anything to encourage or discourage carbon emissions, and that people can choose to spend their money on products made by companies who are more carbon-neutral. There are several problems here - first, the less wealthy you are, the less you can worry about things like a manufacturer's carbon footprint. So, even if you are concerned about the issue but you don't have much money, you have to be more concerned about eating. Second, this favors corporation. A company is going to take the road that makes the most profit. \\n\\nSince global warming can be a contentious issue, let's talk about citizens united. Johnson says citizens united is a first amendment issue, and a corporation should be able to donate as much as they want. By its very nature, this gives the privileged and wealthy more influence over the government than the poor. This is EXACTLY the place where there should be some federal regulation to protect the less privileged class. </td><td>null</td><td>2016-09-05T20:01:20.000+0000</td><td>5.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>false</td><td>0.085</td><td>0.734</td><td>0.181</td><td>0.9743</td><td>0.08333333333333333</td><td>0.4126543209876543</td><td>false</td></tr><tr><td>18.0</td><td>clinton</td><td>CMNT</td><td>d7avctp</td><td>51brat</td><td>Maculate</td><td>politics</td><td>(none)</td><td>(none)</td><td>But it's totally fine because they do some good work.
